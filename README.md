# Data-Reduction-and-Octree-based-Clustering-of-Ligand-Conformations
This repository contains a linear clustering approach for large datasets of molecular geometries produced by high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations (e.g., protein folding and protein-ligand docking simulations). The clustering is adapted for MapReduce and implemented in Hadoop.
